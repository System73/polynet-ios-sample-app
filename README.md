# Readme

- There are two sample projects, one in **Swift** (PolyNetSampleSwift) and one in **Objective-C** (PolyNetSampleObjectiveC). 
- In order to build and run the sample projects you have to add a copy of the PolyNetClient.framework to both of the main projects directories (PolyNetSampleSwift/PolyNetClient.framework and PolyNetSampleObjectiveC/PolyNetClient.framework), so the projects can link and build with the framework.
