# System73Â® PolyNet iOS SDK sample app

This is the integration sample application for the PolyNet iOS SDK.

- There are two sample projects, one in **Swift** (PolyNetSampleSwift) and another in **Objective-C** (PolyNetSampleObjectiveC). 
- In order to build and run any of the sample projects you have to put a copy of the PolyNet iOS SDK (PolyNetClient.framework) in the corresponding project directory.
The Sample application expects to find the iOS SDK in order to successfully link and build the project.
